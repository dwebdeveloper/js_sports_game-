<!--
    1.) Clicking either "SHOOT" button represents a shot for that team.
Shots should have a random chance of succeeding or failing. (Sounds like Internet research time! How do you determine a random chance in JavaScript?)
The number of shots taken should increase for every click of the "SHOOT" button.
The number of goals should only increase when the shot is successful.
    
    2.) Clicking the "RESET" button should reset all the shot and goal counters and add 1 to the number of resets.

    BONUS
Play a sound when someone clicks the "Shoot" button. You'll need to read about the <audio> element and how to use it in JS. You will also need to find a sound file to use.
Use what you know about HTML and CSS to make the page look better!
Upon reset, display who won the game.
Finishing up

Once you have completed your sports game, push your code to a GitHub repository. Submit your GitHub URL.-->
